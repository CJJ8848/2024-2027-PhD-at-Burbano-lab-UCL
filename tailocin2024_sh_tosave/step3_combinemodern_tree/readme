handm_tree.sh  mergehandm_calculatecoveredlist.sh  modern85_extractfasta.sh 

run modern85_extractfasta.sh then
run mergehandm_calculatecoveredlist.sh to have the nonN coordinate list of all samples/
Run mergehandm_calculatecoveredlist_maskexceptlongest.sh to have only the longest chunk (used to plot the coordinate figure)
then handm_tree to have a tree

Details of the strategy please refer to the notion note 'week 26 redo tailocin'
